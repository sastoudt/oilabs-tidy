## Logistics

This lab will occur remotely and in pairs (there may be one group of three). For those of you participating synchronously, you will find the Zoom room information on [Moodle](https://moodle.smith.edu/). I will assign you to a breakout room with your partner(s). 

For those participating syncronously I will be available in the main Zoom room to answer questions. If you have a question or technical problem, click the "Ask for Help" button (it looks like a question mark) in the meeting controls, and I will be alerted to join your breakout room.  

For those of you participating asynchronously, alert me to technical challengs over Slack DM, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. For questions about the content of the lab, please sign up for an office hour time block. 

Each of you should be writing and running code, examining output, and answering the exercises throughout the lab. However, you only need to turn in one final lab report. To do so, whoever was *not* the main recorder last week should be the main recorder of answers in the lab document this week. It may be helpful to share your screen. 

You all should also feel free to ask and answer questions amongst yourselves via Zoom if participating synchronously or via Slack if participating asynchronously. Please note at the end of the lab document who you consulted for help.


## Getting Started

Along with teaching you how to perform a hypothesis test in R, this lab also has components that will help you as you start your own exploration of a dataset for your final project.

### Load packages

In this lab, we will explore and visualize the data using the **tidyverse** suite of 
packages, and perform statistical inference using **infer**. The data can be found
in the companion package for OpenIntro resources, **openintro**.

Let's load the packages.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(infer)
```

### Creating a reproducible lab report

To create your new lab report, in RStudio, go to New File -> R Markdown... Then, choose From Template and then choose `Lab Report for OpenIntro Statistics Labs` from the list of templates.

### The data

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the Youth
Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey, where it takes data from high 
schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work 
with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during 
one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

Load the `yrbss` data set into your workspace.

```{r load-data}
data(yrbss)
```

There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some 
numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

```{r help-nc}
?yrbss
```


1.  What are the cases in this data set? How many cases are there in our sample? Remember that you can answer this question by viewing the data in the data viewer or by using `glimpse`.

## Exploratory data analysis

You will first start with analyzing the weight of the participants in kilograms:
`weight`.

1.  Use the `summary` function to determine how many observations we are missing weights from. Remember that you will need to specify the dataset and name of the variable you are interested in separated by `$`.


1.  Make an appropriate plot of `weight` (given its type) and describe it's distribution (center, spread, is it skewed or symmetric, how many modes does it have?) You may want to refer to the ggplot [cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) to remember the types of plots we know how to make.


Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler's weight and their
physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps 
us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research
questions.

First, let's create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be coded as either
"yes" if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and "no" if not.

```{r create new var}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(yrbss$physically_active_7d > 2, "yes", "no"))
```


1.  Make a side-by-side boxplot of `physical_3plus` and `weight`. You may want to consult [this resource](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-box-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization) to help you make your plot. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

The box plots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can
also compare the means of the distributions using the following to 
first group the data by the `physical_3plus` variable, and then calculate the mean
`weight` in these groups using the `mean` function while ignoring missing values
by setting the `na.rm` argument to `TRUE`.

```{r by-means}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

There is an observed difference, but is this difference statistically 
significant? In order to answer this question we will conduct a hypothesis test.

## Inference


1.  Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing if the average weights are different for those
who exercise at least times a week and those who don't. (no code necessary here)

Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the `infer` 
workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests. 

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r inf-weight-habit-ht-initial, tidy=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))
```

Notice how you can use the functions `specify` and `calculate` again like you did
for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching
for is the difference in means, with the order being `yes - no != 0`.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null
distribution, which we will save as `null`.

```{r inf-weight-habit-ht-null, tidy=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))
```

Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence.
In one sample cases, the `null` argument can be set to "point" to test a hypothesis
relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within `generate` is set to `permute`, which 
is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test. This will shuffle the labels of "yes" and "no".

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
names(null_dist)

ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


1. How many of these `null` permutations have a difference of at least `obs_diff`? Hint: take inspiration from `mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(yrbss$physically_active_7d > 2, "yes", "no"))` to create a new column that has the yes/no answer you want and then use the `count` function.

Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, you can calculate
the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `get_p_value`.

```{r inf-weight-habit-ht-pvalue}
null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")
```

This is the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

1. Report the statistical results. (is our result statistically significant at the 0.05 level? what are the implications for our hypotheses?)

* * *

1. Bonus: Come up with a research question evaluating the relationship between height 
or weight and sleep. Formulate the question in a way that it can be answered using
a hypothesis test.

## Deliverables

When you are finished editing your Markdown document click the "Knit" button and choose "Knit to HTML" in the top left corner of RStudio. This will run all of your code and create a formatted document of the output. You may notice that it takes longer to knit this lab than previous ones. This is because the bootstrap procedure takes more computational time for this example.  If you get an error, it means something in your Markdown file isn't right, either an error in code or some error in formatting. Call me into your breakout room, and we will troubleshoot.

Submit your Markdown document and knitted file to [Moodle](https://moodle.smith.edu/) as:
