## Logistics

This lab will occur remotely and in pairs (there may be one group of three). For those of you participating synchronously, you will find the Zoom room information on [Moodle](https://moodle.smith.edu/). I will assign you to a breakout room with your partner(s). 

For those participating syncronously I will be available in the main Zoom room to answer questions. If you have a question or technical problem, click the "Ask for Help" button (it looks like a question mark) in the meeting controls, and I will be alerted to join your breakout room.  

For those of you participating asynchronously, alert me to technical challengs over Slack DM, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. For questions about the content of the lab, please sign up for an office hour time block. 

Each of you should be writing and running code, examining output, and answering the exercises throughout the lab. However, you only need to turn in one final lab report. To do so, one of you can be the main recorder of answers in the lab document. It may be helpful to share your screen. You will be working with this same partner/group for the next lab, so you will switch roles next week. 

You all should also feel free to ask and answer questions amongst yourselves via Zoom if participating synchronously or via Slack if participating asynchronously. Please note at the end of the lab document who you consulted for help.


## Grading the professor

Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate 
the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student 
evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is 
often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of 
non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the 
instructor. The article titled, "Beauty in the classroom: instructors' 
pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity" by Hamermesh and Parker 
found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher 
instructional ratings. 

Here, you will analyze the data from this study in order to learn what goes 
into a positive professor evaluation. The goal is to show you how to fit and evaluate the models that you will be using in your final project.

## Getting Started

### Load packages

In this lab, you will explore and visualize the data using the **tidyverse** suite of 
packages. The data can be found in the companion package for OpenIntro resources, **openintro**.

Let's load the packages.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```


### Creating a reproducible lab report

To create your new lab report, in RStudio, go to New File -> R Markdown... Then, choose From Template and then choose `Lab Report for OpenIntro Statistics Labs` from the list of templates.

### The data

The data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large 
sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, six 
students rated the professors' physical appearance. The result is a data frame 
where each row contains a different course and columns represent variables about 
the courses and professors. It's called `evals`.

```{r}
glimpse(evals)
```

We have observations on 21 different variables, some categorical and some 
numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

```{r help-evals}
?evals
```

## Exploring the data

1.  Make a plot of the distribution of `score` and describe it. Is the distribution skewed? 
    
2.  Make a plot of the relationship between `score` and  beauty score `bty_avg` (we want to use beauty score to help us understand score) and describe this relationship. 

3. Adapt your plot from #2 by using `col = gender` within `aes` to see how the relationship differs by gender of the faculty member. (just code and plot here, no extra interpretation)


## Simple linear regression

```{r}
base_model <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)
summary(base_model)
```

Using `geom_smooth` and choosing `method = "lm"` will add the simple linear regression line to the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(evals, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
```

4. Interpret this slope in context.

5. The last column `Pr(>|t|)` gives a p-value for the hypothesis test of statistical significance for each coefficient (in this case intercept and slope for `bty_avg`). In each case the null hypothesis is that the coefficient is equal to 0 and the alternative hypothesis is that the coefficient is not equal to zero. Is the intercept statistically significantly different from zero at the 0.01 signifcance level? How about the slope?

## Parallel Slopes

A parallel slope approach is denoted with a plus sign between two covariates.


```{r}
parallel_slopes_model <- lm(score ~ bty_avg + gender, data = evals)
summary(parallel_slopes_model)
```

We can use `geom_abline` to specify the slope and intercept for each category so that we can draw two lines on the plot. When plotting two categories, #00BFC4 is the default color for the reference category and "#F8766D" is the default color for a second category, so we specify those to match the points. In your projects, you might want to do this more automatically. See [this reference](https://moderndive.github.io/moderndive/reference/geom_parallel_slopes.html) for guidance.

```{r}
ggplot(evals, aes(bty_avg, score, col = gender)) + geom_point() + geom_abline(slope = 0.07416, intercept = 3.74734, col = "#00BFC4") + geom_abline(slope = 0.07416, intercept = 3.74734 - 0.17239, col = "#F8766D")
```

6. Write the equation of the regression line for females.

You may want to refer to this sample formatting in the Rmd to make it look "nice".
\[
  \hat{y} = 4.61707 + 0.49143 \times pf\_expression\_control
\]

## Interaction Model 

An interaction is denoted as a product (*) between two covariates. 

```{r}
interaction_model <- lm(score ~ bty_avg * gender, data = evals)
summary(interaction_model)
```

Using `geom_smooth` and choosing `method = "lm"` will add the interaction linear regression line to the plot (ggplot knows to make a different line per gender because the points are colored by gender).

```{r}
ggplot(evals, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score, col = gender)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
```

7. Write the equation of the regression line for females.

## Which is best?

8. One way to define "best" is to consider how much of the variability in the scores are explained by the model. Compare the multiple R-squared values for these three models. Based on this criteria, which model is "best"?

## Checking conditions

```{r,eval = F}
modelToUse = ## add name of your chosen model to the right of this equal sign
  
ggplot(data = modelToUse, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25) +
  xlab("Residuals")

ggplot(data = modelToUse, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
```

9. We've assessed linearity in Exercise 2, but are the other two conditions met for the model you chose as "best"? (normality of residuals and constant variance)

## Finished early?

Talk to you partner(s) about any questions you have for the exam. Alternatively, rejoin the main Zoom room if you have exam related questions, and I'll answer them in between helping groups with the lab. 

## Deliverables

When you are finished editing your Markdown document click the "Knit" button and choose "Knit to HTML" in the top left corner of RStudio. This will run all of your code and create a formatted document of the output.  If you get an error, it means something in your Markdown file isn't right, either an error in code or some error in formatting. Call me into your breakout room, and we will troubleshoot.

Submit your Markdown document and knitted file to [Moodle](https://moodle.smith.edu/) as:

LastName-LastName-L-08.Rmd  (add a third last name if applicable)
